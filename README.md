# DS1302T
This is the Tambellini's read only DS1302's low footprint library.

It was created to be used in my DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) radio receiver project codename Indeciso.
Indeciso is a brazilian portuguese word used to define an indecisive person, this word was chosen because
the radio blocks are modular, so you can change the mixer, the audio amplifier, the RF amplifier circuit
and other blocks as you want.
